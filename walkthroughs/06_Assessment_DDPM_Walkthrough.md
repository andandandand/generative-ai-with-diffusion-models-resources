# Walkthrough: Final Assessment - Mastery of DDPM Through MNIST Generation

## Overview

The 06_Assessment.ipynb notebook represents the **culmination of the entire DDPM course sequence**, serving as a comprehensive final examination where students must demonstrate mastery of all concepts learned across the previous five notebooks. This practical assessment challenges students to independently implement a complete diffusion model for MNIST handwritten digit generation, with success measured by achieving **95% accuracy** on a pre-trained classifier.

## Course Context & Assessment Philosophy

### The Complete Learning Journey

This assessment caps a carefully orchestrated 7-notebook educational sequence:

1. **01_UNets**: Foundation denoising concepts
2. **02_Diffusion_Models**: Complete DDPM mathematical framework
3. **03_Optimizations**: Advanced architectural improvements
4. **04_Classifier_Free_Diffusion**: Controllable generation with category conditioning
5. **05_CLIP**: Natural language conditioning for text-to-image generation
6. **06_Assessment**: Independent mastery demonstration ← **Current**

### Assessment Design Principles

**Practical Application**: Rather than theoretical questions, students must build a working generative model that produces measurable results.

**Incremental Guidance**: The notebook provides structured TODO sections that test specific implementation skills while allowing creative problem-solving.

**Real-World Standards**: The 95% classifier accuracy threshold mirrors industry expectations for production-quality generative models.

**Comprehensive Integration**: Every major concept from the course is required for successful completion.

## Challenge Overview: MNIST Digit Generation

### The Task

Students must train a diffusion model to generate handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset that are **indistinguishable from real digits** to a pre-trained classifier with 99% accuracy on the MNIST test set.

### Success Criteria

- **Quantitative Metric**: 95% accuracy when generated images are evaluated by the pre-trained classifier
- **Qualitative Assessment**: Generated digits must be visually recognizable and well-formed
- **Technical Implementation**: All TODO sections must be correctly completed

### Why MNIST for Assessment?

1. **Clear Success Metric**: Digits are either recognizable or they aren't
2. **Computational Efficiency**: 28×28 grayscale images allow rapid iteration during the exam
3. **Familiar Domain**: Students can visually assess their progress
4. **Measurable Quality**: Classifier accuracy provides objective evaluation

## Dataset Foundation & Preprocessing

### MNIST Loading and Transformation

```python
def load_transformed_MNIST(img_size, batch_size):
    data_transforms = [
        transforms.Resize((img_size, img_size)),
        transforms.ToTensor(),  # Scales data into [0,1]
    ]
```

**Key Differences from Previous Notebooks**:
- **No Horizontal Flip**: Unlike FashionMNIST, digits shouldn't be mirror-flipped (6 vs 9 confusion)
- **Grayscale Preservation**: Single channel (IMG_CH = 1) maintains digit clarity
- **Standard Resolution**: 28×28 pixels matches the classifier's expected input

### Assessment-Specific Parameters

```python
IMG_SIZE = 28      # Classifier requirement
IMG_CH = 1         # Grayscale digits
BATCH_SIZE = 128   # Efficient training batch size
N_CLASSES = 10     # Digits 0-9
```

These parameters are **fixed constraints** that students must work within, simulating real-world deployment requirements.

## Diffusion Process Mathematics: Testing Core Understanding

### Hyperparameter Configuration

```python
T = nrows * ncols  # T = 150 (10 × 15 grid)
B_start = 0.0001
B_end = 0.02
B = torch.linspace(B_start, B_end, T).to(device)
```

**Assessment Strategy**: The noise schedule is provided, allowing students to focus on implementation rather than hyperparameter tuning.

### TODO 1: Mathematical Coefficients

**Student Challenge**: Complete the fundamental DDPM coefficients

```python
a = 1.0 - B
a_bar = FIXME(a, dim=0)                    # → torch.cumprod
sqrt_a_bar = FIXME(a_bar)                  # → torch.sqrt
sqrt_one_minus_a_bar = FIXME(1 - a_bar)   # → torch.sqrt
```

**DDPM Theory Connection**: These coefficients implement the mathematical foundation:
- $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$
- $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^t \alpha_i$
- $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}$ and $\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}$ enable the reparameterization trick

### TODO 2: Forward Diffusion Implementation

**Student Challenge**: Implement the core forward process

```python
def q(x_0, t):
    # Students must complete:
    x_t = FIXME * x_0 + FIXME * noise
    # Solution: sqrt_a_bar_t * x_0 + sqrt_one_minus_a_bar_t * noise
```

**Mathematical Foundation**: This implements the closed-form forward diffusion:

$$q(x_t|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0, (1-\bar{\alpha}_t) I)$$

**Assessment Focus**: Tests understanding of the reparameterization trick that enables efficient training.

### TODO 3: Reverse Diffusion Implementation

**Student Challenge**: Complete the reverse sampling process

```python
def reverse_q(x_t, t, e_t):
    u_t = sqrt_a_inv_t * (FIXME - pred_noise_coeff_t * FIXME)
    # Students must identify: x_t and e_t
    if FIXME[0] == 0:  # Students must identify: t
```

**Mathematical Foundation**: Implements the reverse mean calculation:

$$\tilde{\mu}_t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left( x_t - \frac{1-\alpha_t}{\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}} \epsilon_t \right)$$

**Assessment Strategy**: Tests both mathematical understanding and implementation debugging skills.

## U-Net Architecture Mastery: Advanced Component Recognition

### TODO 4: Component Identification Challenge

Students must correctly identify seven sophisticated architectural components:

**1. DownBlock** - Multi-scale feature extraction
```python
class FIXME(nn.Module):  # → DownBlock
    def __init__(self, in_chs, out_chs, group_size):
        layers = [
            GELUConvBlock(in_chs, out_chs, group_size),
            GELUConvBlock(out_chs, out_chs, group_size),
            RearrangePoolBlock(out_chs, group_size),
        ]
```

**2. EmbedBlock** - Time and context conditioning
```python
class FIXME(nn.Module):  # → EmbedBlock
    def __init__(self, input_dim, emb_dim):
        layers = [
            nn.Linear(input_dim, emb_dim),
            nn.GELU(),
            nn.Unflatten(1, (emb_dim, 1, 1)),
        ]
```

**3. GELUConvBlock** - Advanced activation functions
```python
class FIXME(nn.Module):  # → GELUConvBlock
    def __init__(self, in_ch, out_ch, group_size):
        layers = [
            nn.Conv2d(in_ch, out_ch, 3, 1, 1),
            nn.GroupNorm(group_size, out_ch),
            nn.GELU(),
        ]
```

**4. RearrangePoolBlock** - Learnable downsampling
```python
class FIXME(nn.Module):  # → RearrangePoolBlock
    def __init__(self, in_chs, group_size):
        self.rearrange = Rearrange("b c (h p1) (w p2) -> b (c p1 p2) h w", p1=2, p2=2)
```

**5. ResidualConvBlock** - Skip connections for gradient flow
```python
class FIXME(nn.Module):  # → ResidualConvBlock
    def forward(self, x):
        x1 = self.conv1(x)
        x2 = self.conv2(x1)
        out = x1 + x2  # Residual connection
        return out
```

**6. SinusoidalPositionEmbedBlock** - Advanced time encoding
```python
class FIXME(nn.Module):  # → SinusoidalPositionEmbedBlock
    def forward(self, time):
        embeddings = torch.exp(torch.arange(half_dim, device=device) * -embeddings)
        embeddings = torch.cat((embeddings.sin(), embeddings.cos()), dim=-1)
```

**7. UpBlock** - Multi-scale reconstruction with skip connections
```python
class FIXME(nn.Module):  # → UpBlock
    def forward(self, x, skip):
        x = torch.cat((x, skip), 1)  # Skip connection integration
        x = self.model(x)
        return x
```

**Assessment Strategy**: This component identification tests deep architectural understanding developed across notebooks 01-05.

## Training Process: Classifier-Free Guidance Implementation

### TODO 5: Context Masking Implementation

**Student Challenge**: Implement Bernoulli masking for dual learning

```python
def get_context_mask(c, drop_prob):
    c_hot = F.one_hot(c.to(torch.int64), num_classes=N_CLASSES).to(device)
    c_mask = torch.FIXME(torch.ones_like(c_hot).float() - drop_prob).to(device)
    # Solution: torch.bernoulli
    return c_hot, c_mask
```

**DDPM Theory Connection**: Implements the dual learning strategy from Notebook 04:
- **90% Conditional Training**: Model learns digit-specific generation
- **10% Unconditional Training**: Model learns general digit patterns

### TODO 6: Loss Function Selection

**Student Challenge**: Choose the correct loss function

```python
def get_loss(model, x_0, t, *model_args):
    x_noisy, noise = q(x_0, t)
    noise_pred = model(x_noisy, t, *model_args)
    return F.FIXME(noise, noise_pred)  # → mse_loss
```

**Mathematical Foundation**: Implements the DDPM training objective:

$$L = \mathbb{E}_{t,x_0,\epsilon}[||\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c)||^2]$$

### TODO 7: Training Loop Configuration

**Student Challenge**: Set appropriate hyperparameters

```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for step, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
        c_drop_prob = FIXME  # → 0.1 (10% drop probability)
        c_hot, c_mask = get_context_mask(FIXME, c_drop_prob)  # → batch[1] (labels)
```

**Assessment Focus**: Tests understanding of the complete training pipeline integrating all course concepts.

## Classifier-Free Guidance: Advanced Sampling Implementation

### The Weighted Sampling Formula

**Student Challenge**: Complete the classifier-free guidance equation

```python
def sample_w(model, c, w):
    # ... setup code ...
    e_t = model(x_t, t, c, c_mask)
    e_t_keep_c = e_t[:n_samples]      # Conditional predictions
    e_t_drop_c = e_t[n_samples:]      # Unconditional predictions
    e_t = FIXME  # → (1 + w) * e_t_keep_c - w * e_t_drop_c
```

**Mathematical Foundation**: Implements classifier-free guidance:

$$\epsilon_{\text{guided}} = (1 + w) \times \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c) - w \times \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, \emptyset)$$

Where:
- $w$ is the guidance weight
- $c$ is the digit class conditioning
- $\emptyset$ represents unconditional generation

### Guidance Weight Tuning

**Student Challenge**: Optimize the guidance weight for 95% accuracy

```python
w = 0.0  # Change me
```

**Assessment Strategy**: Students must experimentally determine that values around $w = 2.0$ to $w = 5.0$ typically achieve the required accuracy.

**Quality vs. Guidance Trade-offs**:
- **w = 0**: Standard conditional generation
- **w = 2**: Enhanced digit characteristics
- **w = 5**: Very sharp, classifier-friendly digits
- **w > 10**: Potential artifacts but maximum classifier scores

## Assessment Methodology & Success Criteria
