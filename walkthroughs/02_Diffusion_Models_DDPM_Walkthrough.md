## Introduction: Solving the "Ink Blot" Problem {#introduction}

### The Challenge from 01_UNets

In the previous notebook, we discovered a fundamental limitation: while U-Nets could effectively remove a fixed amount of noise (50%) from images, they produced "ink blot" patterns when trying to generate from pure noise. This failure revealed three critical missing components:

1. **No Time Conditioning**: The model couldn't distinguish between different noise levels
2. **Single-Step Limitation**: Complex generation requires iterative refinement
3. **Training Distribution Mismatch**: Trained on 50% noise, tested on 100% noise

### The DDPM Solution

This notebook (`02_Diffusion_Models.ipynb`) implements the complete **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models** framework proposed by Ho et al. (2020), which elegantly solves all these limitations through:

**🎯 Core Innovation**: Transform single-step denoising into **iterative refinement** over multiple timesteps, where each step removes a small, learnable amount of noise.

### Key Theoretical Advances

| Component | 01_UNets Approach | 02_Diffusion DDPM Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| **Noise Addition** | Single step: $x_{\text{noisy}} = 0.5x + 0.5\epsilon$ | Sequential: $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$ over T steps |
| **Network Input** | $\text{U-Net}(x_{\text{noisy}})$ | $\text{U-Net}(x_t, t)$ with time conditioning |
| **Training Target** | Direct image reconstruction | Noise prediction $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \approx \epsilon$ |
| **Generation** | Single forward pass | Iterative sampling over T steps |
| **Mathematical Framework** | Ad-hoc noise mixing | Rigorous probabilistic formulation |

### Learning Objectives from DDPM Perspective

By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:
- **Forward Diffusion**: How to systematically corrupt data over T timesteps
- **Reverse Diffusion**: How to learn the reverse process for generation
- **Time Conditioning**: Why and how networks need temporal understanding
- **Noise Prediction**: Why predicting noise works better than predicting images
- **Iterative Sampling**: How generation becomes a controlled refinement process

## Forward Diffusion Process: Mathematical Foundation {#forward-diffusion}

### The Variance Schedule: Designing Noise Progression

The forward diffusion process is governed by a **variance schedule** $\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_T$ that controls how much noise is added at each timestep.

```python
# Cell 5: Variance schedule definition
T = 150  # Total timesteps
start = 0.0001
end = 0.02
B = torch.linspace(start, end, T).to(device)
```

**Design Principles**:
1. **Start Small**: $\beta_1 = 0.0001$ ensures minimal corruption initially
2. **End Manageable**: $\beta_T = 0.02$ keeps final noise level reasonable
3. **Linear Increase**: Gradually increases noise addition rate
4. **Total Steps**: $T = 150$ balances quality vs. computational cost

### Sequential Forward Process: The Markov Chain

The forward diffusion process is defined as a Markov chain:

$$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} \cdot x_{t-1}, \beta_t \cdot I)$$

**Mathematical Insight**: Each step applies a **Gaussian perturbation** where:
- **Mean**: $\sqrt{1-\beta_t} \cdot x_{t-1}$ (slightly shrinks the signal)
- **Variance**: $\beta_t$ (adds controlled noise)

```python
# Cell 9: Sequential forward diffusion
for t in range(T):
    noise = torch.randn_like(x_t)
    x_t = torch.sqrt(1 - B[t]) * x_t + torch.sqrt(B[t]) * noise
```

**Why This Works**:
1. **Gradual Corruption**: Each step adds only a small amount of noise
2. **Signal Preservation**: $\sqrt{1-\beta_t}$ term keeps some original structure
3. **Controlled Randomness**: $\beta_t$ controls the noise injection rate
4. **Markov Property**: Each step only depends on the previous step

### The Normal Distribution Connection

The choice of Gaussian noise is not arbitrary. The central equation:

$$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} \cdot x_{t-1}, \beta_t \cdot I)$$

Can be sampled using the **reparameterization trick**:

$$x_t = \sqrt{1-\beta_t} \cdot x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t} \cdot \epsilon$$

Where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$ is standard Gaussian noise.

**DDPM Theory Connection**: This formulation ensures that the reverse process can be learned as a denoising operation, which neural networks excel at.

---

## The Reparameterization Trick: Direct Sampling {#reparameterization}

### The Computational Challenge

Sequential sampling requires T forward passes for each training example:
$$x_0 \rightarrow x_1 \rightarrow x_2 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow x_T$$

This is computationally expensive and unnecessary for training.

### The Mathematical Solution: Cumulative Products

Through recursive substitution, we can derive a **closed-form expression** that jumps directly to any timestep:

$$q(x_t|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \cdot x_0, (1-\bar{\alpha}_t) \cdot I)$$

Where $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^t \alpha_i$ and $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$.

```python
# Cell 15: Precomputing the cumulative products
a = 1. - B
a_bar = torch.cumprod(a, dim=0)
sqrt_a_bar = torch.sqrt(a_bar)  # Mean coefficient
sqrt_one_minus_a_bar = torch.sqrt(1 - a_bar)  # Std coefficient
```

### The Direct Sampling Function

```python
# Cell 17: Direct sampling implementation
def q(x_0, t):
    noise = torch.randn_like(x_0)
    sqrt_a_bar_t = sqrt_a_bar[t, None, None, None]
    sqrt_one_minus_a_bar_t = sqrt_one_minus_a_bar[t, None, None, None]

    x_t = sqrt_a_bar_t * x_0 + sqrt_one_minus_a_bar_t * noise
    return x_t, noise
```

**Key Insights**:

1. **Single-Step Computation**: Jump directly from $x_0$ to $x_t$
2. **Training Efficiency**: No need for sequential corruption during training
3. **Mathematical Elegance**: Closed-form solution simplifies implementation
4. **Noise Tracking**: Returns both noisy image and the noise added

### Broadcasting and Tensor Operations

The code uses **broadcasting** to handle batch operations efficiently:

```python
sqrt_a_bar_t = sqrt_a_bar[t, None, None, None]  # Shape: [batch, 1, 1, 1]
```

This allows element-wise multiplication across all pixels while maintaining different noise levels for each batch element.

**Tensor Dimensions**:
- $x_0$: [batch, channels, height, width]
- $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}$: [batch, 1, 1, 1] (broadcasts to match $x_0$)
- Result: Each image in batch gets appropriate noise level for its timestep

---

## Time Conditioning: Teaching Networks Temporal Awareness {#time-conditioning}

### The Fundamental Challenge

Unlike the single-noise-level approach in 01_UNets, DDPM requires the network to handle T different noise levels. The key insight: **the network must know which timestep it's processing**.

### Why Time Conditioning is Essential

Consider the difference between these scenarios:
- **t = 1**: Almost clean image, need to remove tiny amounts of noise
- **t = 75**: Moderately noisy image, need balanced denoising
- **t = 149**: Nearly pure noise, need aggressive structure recovery

**Without time conditioning**: The network sees the same noisy input but has no idea how much noise to remove.

**With time conditioning**: The network learns $f(x_t, t) \rightarrow \text{noise\_prediction}$, adapting its behavior based on timestep.

### Embedding Block Architecture

```python
# Cell 25: Time embedding implementation
class EmbedBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, emb_dim):
        super().__init__()
        layers = [
            nn.Linear(input_dim, emb_dim),     # Project scalar to vector
            nn.ReLU(),                         # Non-linearity
            nn.Linear(emb_dim, emb_dim),       # Further processing
            nn.Unflatten(1, (emb_dim, 1, 1))  # Reshape for broadcasting
        ]
```

**Architecture Breakdown**:

1. **Input Processing**: $t \in [0, T-1]$ → normalized to $[0, 1]$
2. **Linear Projection**: Scalar timestep → dense vector representation
3. **Non-linear Processing**: ReLU activation enables complex mappings
4. **Spatial Broadcasting**: Reshape to enable addition with feature maps

### Integration with U-Net Architecture

The time embeddings are integrated at specific points in the U-Net:

```python
# Cell 34: Time embedding integration
def forward(self, x, t):
    # Encoder
    down0 = self.down0(x)
    down1 = self.down1(down0)
    down2 = self.down2(down1)

    # Time processing
    t = t.float() / T  # Normalize to [0, 1]
    temb_1 = self.temb_1(t)
    temb_2 = self.temb_2(t)

    # Decoder with time conditioning
    up0 = self.up0(latent_vec)
    up1 = self.up1(up0 + temb_1, down2)  # Add time embedding
    up2 = self.up2(up1 + temb_2, down1)  # Add time embedding
```

**Design Choices**:

1. **Decoder-Only Integration**: Time embeddings are added during upsampling
2. **Additive Combination**: `feature_map + time_embedding` preserves spatial structure
3. **Multiple Scales**: Different embeddings for different resolution levels
4. **Normalization**: Time values normalized to [0,1] for stable training

### Why This Architecture Works

**Spatial Consistency**: Adding time embeddings (rather than concatenating) preserves the spatial structure of feature maps while providing temporal context.

**Multi-Scale Awareness**: Different time embeddings at different U-Net levels allow the network to apply time-aware processing at multiple resolutions.

**Gradient Flow**: Additive connections maintain clean gradient paths for both spatial and temporal information.

## Noise Prediction vs. Image Reconstruction {#noise-prediction}

### The Paradigm Shift

One of the most important innovations in DDPM is the shift from **image reconstruction** to **noise prediction**:

| Approach | Loss Function | Network Output | Training Signal |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **01_UNets** | `MSE(x_0, model(x_noisy))` | Predicted clean image | Direct reconstruction |
| **02_Diffusion** | `MSE(ε, model(x_t, t))` | Predicted noise | Noise identification |

### The Mathematical Foundation

The original DDPM derivation starts with the **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)**:

$$L = \mathbb{E}_q[\log p_\theta(x_{0:T})/q(x_{1:T}|x_0)]$$

Through mathematical derivation (detailed in the Ho et al. paper), this simplifies to:

$$L_{\text{simple}} = \mathbb{E}_{t,x_0,\epsilon}[||\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)||^2]$$

Where:
- $\epsilon$: The actual noise added at timestep t
- $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$: The network's prediction of that noise
- $x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon$: The noisy image

### Implementation: The Loss Function

```python
# Cell 38: Noise prediction loss
def get_loss(model, x_0, t):
    x_noisy, noise = q(x_0, t)           # Add noise, keep track of what was added
    noise_pred = model(x_noisy, t)       # Predict the noise
    return F.mse_loss(noise, noise_pred) # Compare actual vs predicted noise
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:

1. **Noise Addition**: $q(x_0, t)$ corrupts the clean image and returns both $x_t$ and $\epsilon$
2. **Noise Prediction**: Model sees $x_t$ and $t$, predicts what noise was added
3. **Loss Computation**: MSE between actual noise and predicted noise

### Why Noise Prediction Works Better

**1. Easier Learning Target**:
- **Image Reconstruction**: Must learn to generate complex, structured outputs
- **Noise Prediction**: Must identify random patterns (simpler statistical task)

**2. Better Gradient Signals**:
- **Image Reconstruction**: Gradients can be weak for high-frequency details
- **Noise Prediction**: Clear signal for what patterns to identify as noise

**3. Multiscale Effectiveness**:
- **Image Reconstruction**: Must handle all frequency components simultaneously
- **Noise Prediction**: Can focus on noise patterns at appropriate scales

**4. Generalization Properties**:
- **Image Reconstruction**: May overfit to specific image structures
- **Noise Prediction**: Learns general denoising principles

### Training Dynamics

The training process becomes:

```python
# Random timestep for each batch element
t = torch.randint(0, T, (BATCH_SIZE,))

# Forward diffusion: add noise
x_noisy, actual_noise = q(x_0, t)

# Reverse diffusion: predict noise
predicted_noise = model(x_noisy, t)

# Learn to identify noise patterns
loss = MSE(actual_noise, predicted_noise)
```

This creates a **denoising curriculum** where the network learns to identify noise patterns at all levels of corruption.

---

## Reverse Diffusion Process: The Generation Engine {#reverse-diffusion}

### The Mathematical Framework

While the forward process systematically adds noise, the reverse process learns to remove it. The reverse diffusion is modeled as:

$$p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \sigma_t^2 I)$$

Where the neural network learns to predict the mean $\mu_\theta(x_t, t)$ of the reverse transition.

### Deriving the Reverse Mean

Using Bayes' theorem and properties of Gaussian distributions, the optimal reverse mean is:

$$\tilde{\mu}_t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left( x_t - \frac{1-\alpha_t}{\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}} \epsilon_t \right)$$

Where:
- $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$
- $\bar{\alpha}_t$ is the cumulative product
- $\epsilon_t$ is the noise that was added at timestep t

### Implementation: The Reverse Sampling Function

```python
# Cell 43: Reverse diffusion implementation
@torch.no_grad()
def reverse_q(x_t, t, e_t):
    t = torch.squeeze(t[0].int())
    pred_noise_coeff_t = pred_noise_coeff[t]
    sqrt_a_inv_t = sqrt_a_inv[t]

    # Compute the mean of the reverse distribution
    u_t = sqrt_a_inv_t * (x_t - pred_noise_coeff_t * e_t)

    if t == 0:
        return u_t  # No noise at final step
    else:
        B_t = B[t-1]
        new_noise = torch.randn_like(x_t)
        return u_t + torch.sqrt(B_t) * new_noise
```

**Mathematical Mapping**:
- `sqrt_a_inv_t` = $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}}$
- `pred_noise_coeff_t` = $\frac{1-\alpha_t}{\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}}$
- `u_t` is the computed mean $\tilde{\mu}_t$
- Additional noise maintains stochasticity (except at t=0)

### The Generation Process

```python
# Cell 45: Iterative sampling
def sample_images(ncols, figsize=(8,8)):
    # Start with pure noise
    x_t = torch.randn((1, IMG_CH, IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE), device=device)

    # Iteratively denoise from T to 0
    for i in range(0, T)[::-1]:
        t = torch.full((1,), i, device=device)
        e_t = model(x_t, t)           # Predict noise at current step
        x_t = reverse_q(x_t, t, e_t)  # Remove predicted noise
```

**Step-by-Step Generation**:

1. **Initialization**: Start with pure Gaussian noise $x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$
2. **Iterative Denoising**: For each timestep T, T-1, ..., 1, 0:
   - Use the neural network to predict noise: $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$
   - Apply reverse diffusion to get: $x_{t-1} = \text{reverse\_q}(x_t, t, \epsilon_t)$
3. **Final Output**: After T steps, obtain generated sample $x_0$

### Stochastic vs. Deterministic Sampling

**Stochastic Sampling** (current implementation):
- Adds noise at each step: $x_{t-1} = \mu_t + \sigma_t \cdot z$
- Maintains diversity in generation
- Follows the mathematical framework exactly

**Deterministic Sampling** (DDIM variant):
- Uses only the mean: $x_{t-1} = \mu_t$
- Faster generation with fewer steps
- More deterministic but less diverse

### Why Iterative Refinement Works

**1. Decomposed Complexity**: Instead of solving "noise → image" in one step, solve T simpler problems
**2. Progressive Structure**: Early steps recover global structure, later steps add fine details
**3. Error Correction**: Each step can correct errors from previous predictions
**4. Learned Curriculum**: Network learns appropriate denoising for each noise level

---

## Training Process: Learning the Reverse Mapping {#training-process}

### The Training Algorithm

The DDPM training process elegantly combines all the components we've discussed:

```python
# Cell 47: Complete training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for step, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
        # 1. Sample random timestep for each batch element
        t = torch.randint(0, T, (BATCH_SIZE,), device=device)
        x = batch[0].to(device)

        # 2. Forward diffusion: add noise according to schedule
        loss = get_loss(model, x, t)

        # 3. Backpropagation: learn to predict the noise
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

### Curriculum Learning Analysis

The random timestep sampling creates a natural **curriculum learning** effect:

**Early Training**:
- Network sees all timesteps randomly
- Learns basic denoising patterns across all noise levels
- Develops general noise identification skills

**Later Training**:
- Refines predictions for each specific timestep
- Learns temporal consistency across the denoising trajectory
- Develops sophisticated noise removal strategies

### What the Network Learns

At each timestep `t`, the network learns to identify:

1. **Noise Patterns**: What random noise looks like at this corruption level
2. **Signal Patterns**: What underlying structure remains at this noise level
3. **Temporal Context**: How much denoising is appropriate for this timestep
4. **Spatial Relationships**: How noise affects different parts of the image

### Training Dynamics and Convergence

**Loss Progression**:
- **Early**: High loss as network learns basic denoising
- **Middle**: Rapid improvement as patterns are recognized
- **Later**: Fine-tuning for optimal noise prediction

**Timestep-Specific Learning**:
- **Low t (less noise)**: Learn fine detail recovery
- **Medium t (moderate noise)**: Learn structure preservation
- **High t (high noise)**: Learn global pattern recognition

### Validation During Training

The `sample_images()` function provides real-time feedback:

```python
if epoch % 1 == 0 and step % 100 == 0:
    print(f"Epoch {epoch} | Step {step:03d} | Loss: {loss.item()}")
    sample_images(ncols)
```

**What to Look For**:
- **Epoch 0**: Random noise → slight structure hints
- **Epoch 1**: Recognizable shapes emerge
- **Epoch 2+**: Clear fashion items with fine details

---

## Results Analysis: From Chaos to Structure {#results-analysis}

### The Transformation: Noise to Fashion

The generated samples demonstrate a remarkable transformation from the "ink blot" problem of 01_UNets:

**01_UNets Results**:
- Input: Pure noise
- Output: Blob-like artifacts, no recognizable structure
- Problem: Single-step denoising insufficient for complex generation

**02_Diffusion Results**:
- Input: Pure noise
- Output: Recognizable fashion items (shirts, pants, shoes)
- Success: Iterative refinement enables complex structure generation

### Quality Analysis: What Works and What Doesn't

**Successes** ✅:
1. **Recognizable Objects**: Generated images clearly resemble clothing items
2. **Spatial Coherence**: Objects have proper proportions and layouts
3. **Category Diversity**: Different types of fashion items are generated
4. **Training Stability**: Loss decreases consistently, samples improve over time

**Limitations** ⚠️:
1. **Pixelation**: Images appear somewhat blurry and pixelated
2. **Fine Details**: Missing intricate textures and sharp edges
3. **Artifacts**: Some checkerboard patterns and inconsistencies
4. **Limited Resolution**: 16×16 images lack detail for complex patterns

### The "Pixelated" Problem

The notebook mentions: "It looks a little pixelated. Why would that be?"

**Root Causes**:
1. **Architecture Limitations**: Basic U-Net without modern optimizations
2. **Upsampling Issues**: Max pooling and transposed convolution can create artifacts
3. **Normalization**: Batch normalization may not be optimal for generation
4. **Training Length**: Only 3 epochs may not be sufficient for fine details

**This Sets Up Notebook 03**: The pixelation problem motivates the architectural improvements in `03_Optimizations.ipynb`.

### Comparison with Theoretical Expectations

**DDPM Theory Predictions**:
- Iterative refinement should enable high-quality generation
- Noise prediction should be easier to learn than image reconstruction
- Time conditioning should allow appropriate denoising at each step

**Experimental Results**:
- ✅ Clear improvement over single-step approaches
- ✅ Training converges and generates recognizable objects
- ✅ Different timesteps produce appropriate intermediate results
- ⚠️ Quality limited by architectural constraints

### Hyperparameter Sensitivity

**Timesteps ($T = 150$)**:
- **Too Few**: Insufficient refinement steps
- **Too Many**: Computational overhead, potential instability
- **Current Choice**: Good balance for educational purposes

**Variance Schedule (linear $0.0001 \rightarrow 0.02$)**:
- **Start Value**: Small enough to preserve structure initially
- **End Value**: Large enough for complete corruption
- **Schedule Shape**: Linear is simple but may not be optimal

**Learning Rate (0.001)**:
- Balanced for stable training without overshooting
- Allows convergence within the limited epoch budget

## Complete DDPM Framework: Theory Integration {#ddpm-framework}

### Mathematical Completeness

This notebook implements the complete DDPM framework as described in "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" (Ho et al., 2020):

**Forward Process**:
$$q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = \prod_{i=1}^T q(x_i|x_{i-1})$$
$$q(x_i|x_{i-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_i; \sqrt{1-\beta_i}x_{i-1}, \beta_i I)$$

**Reverse Process**:
$$p_\theta(x_{0:T}) = p(x_T) \prod_{i=1}^T p_\theta(x_{i-1}|x_i)$$
$$p_\theta(x_{i-1}|x_i) = \mathcal{N}(x_{i-1}; \mu_\theta(x_i,i), \sigma_i^2 I)$$

**Training Objective**:
$$L_{\text{simple}} = \mathbb{E}_{t,x_0,\epsilon}[||\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon, t)||^2]$$

### Key Theoretical Contributions Implemented

**1. Variance Preservation**:
The forward process is designed to preserve variance through the coefficients $\sqrt{1-\beta_t}$ and $\beta_t$.

**2. Tractable Training**:
The reparameterization trick enables direct sampling at any timestep without sequential computation.

**3. Noise Parameterization**:
Predicting noise rather than images leads to better training dynamics and generation quality.

**4. Markov Structure**:
The reverse process maintains Markov properties, enabling local decision-making at each timestep.

### Connection to Broader Diffusion Literature

**Score-Based Models**: DDPM is equivalent to score-based generative models, where the score function $\nabla_x \log p(x)$ is learned through denoising.

**Stochastic Differential Equations**: The discrete diffusion process can be viewed as the discretization of continuous SDEs.

**Energy-Based Models**: The reverse process can be interpreted as learning the energy landscape of the data distribution.

### Research Context and Impact

**Before DDPM**:
- GANs dominated generative modeling but suffered from training instability
- VAEs provided stable training but often produced blurry samples
- Autoregressive models worked well but were slow for images

**DDPM Innovation**:
- Stable training process like VAEs
- High-quality samples rivaling GANs
- Principled mathematical framework
- Parallelizable generation process

**After DDPM**:
- Sparked the diffusion model revolution
- Led to DALL-E 2, Imagen, Stable Diffusion
- Enabled text-to-image generation breakthroughs
- Influenced video, audio, and 3D generation

The transformation from 01_UNets' "ink blot" problem to recognizable fashion item generation demonstrates the power of systematic, principled approaches to machine learning. While quality limitations remain (motivating the next notebook), the fundamental breakthrough has been achieved: **learned iterative refinement can generate complex, structured data from noise**.

This foundation enables all subsequent advances in the course and provides the theoretical understanding necessary to engage with cutting-edge research in generative modeling. The principles learned here—mathematical rigor, iterative improvement, and noise prediction—remain central to the most advanced text-to-image systems in use today.
