# Walkthrough: CLIP Integration - Text-to-Image Generation with DDPM

## Overview

This notebook represents the **culmination of the DDPM course sequence**, introducing the revolutionary capability of **text-to-image generation** through CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) integration. This marks the transition from controllable generation with discrete categories to natural language conditioning - the foundation technology behind modern AI systems like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.

## Course Context & Learning Progression

### Complete Educational Journey

The 05_CLIP notebook completes a carefully orchestrated learning progression:

1.  **Notebook 01 (U-Nets)**: Basic denoising architecture foundations
2.  **Notebook 02 (Diffusion Models)**: Complete DDPM framework implementation
3.  **Notebook 03 (Optimizations)**: Architectural improvements for quality generation
4.  **Notebook 04 (Classifier-Free Diffusion)**: Controllable generation with category conditioning
5.  **Notebook 05 (CLIP)**: Natural language conditioning for text-to-image generation ‚Üê **Current**
6.  **Notebook 06 (Assessment)**: Final evaluation and certification

### The Natural Language Revolution

While previous notebooks demonstrated impressive controllable generation using discrete categories (T-shirt, dress, shoes, etc.), this notebook breaks the barrier between human language and AI generation. Instead of selecting from predefined categories, users can now describe their desired image in natural language: *"A round white daisy with a yellow center"* or *"An orange sunflower with a big brown center"*.

## Understanding CLIP: The Bridge Between Language and Vision

### What is CLIP?

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) is **not a generative model** itself, but rather a revolutionary **alignment tool** that creates a shared embedding space for text and images. The core insight: if there exists a perfect text description of an image, CLIP's goal is to create **identical vector embeddings** for both the image and its description.

```python
import clip

# Load CLIP model - ViT-B/32 with 512 features
clip_model, clip_preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32")
clip_model.eval()
CLIP_FEATURES = 512
```

**Key Innovation**: CLIP learns to map semantically equivalent text and images to the same point in a 512-dimensional embedding space, enabling seamless translation between linguistic descriptions and visual content.

### CLIP Architecture & Technical Foundation

#### Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32)
CLIP uses a Vision Transformer architecture that:
- Processes images as sequences of patches
- Generates 512-dimensional embeddings
- Maintains spatial relationships through attention mechanisms
- Provides robust feature representations for diverse visual content

#### Text Encoding Pipeline
```python
text_list = [
    "A round white daisy with a yellow center",
    "An orange sunflower with a big brown center",
    "A red rose bud"
]
text_tokens = clip.tokenize(text_list).to(device)
clip_text_encodings = clip_model.encode_text(text_tokens).float()
```

The text encoding process:
1.  **Tokenization**: Convert words to integer tokens
2.  **Transformer Processing**: Multi-head attention over token sequences
3.  **Embedding Generation**: 512-dimensional text representations
4.  **Normalization**: Prepare for similarity calculations

## DDPM Theory Extension: From Categories to Natural Language

### Mathematical Formulation Evolution

**Original Conditional DDPM (Notebook 04)**:
$p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t, c) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t, c), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t, c))$

Where $c$ was a one-hot encoded category vector (dimension: 10 for FashionMNIST categories).

**CLIP-Enhanced DDPM (Current)**:
$p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t, c_{clip}) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t, c_{clip}), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t, c_{clip}))$

Where $c_{clip}$ is a 512-dimensional CLIP embedding encoding rich semantic information from natural language descriptions.

### The Embedding Alignment Principle

```python
# Image encoding process
clip_imgs = torch.tensor(np.stack([clip_preprocess(img)])).to(device)
clip_img_encoding = clip_model.encode_image(clip_imgs)

# Text encoding process
text_tokens = clip.tokenize(text_list).to(device)
clip_text_encodings = clip_model.encode_text(text_tokens).float()

# Similarity calculation (cosine similarity)
clip_img_encoding /= clip_img_encoding.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
clip_text_encodings /= clip_text_encodings.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
similarity = (clip_text_encodings * clip_img_encoding).sum(-1)
```

**Cosine Similarity Mathematics**:
For normalized vectors, cosine similarity becomes a simple dot product:
$\text{cosine\_sim} = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \times \|B\|} = A \cdot B$ (when $\|A\| = \|B\| = 1$)

Values range from -1 (opposite) to +1 (identical), enabling precise measurement of semantic alignment.

## Dataset Transformation: From Categories to CLIP Embeddings

### The Paradigm Shift

**Previous Approach (Notebook 04)**:
- Labels: Discrete categories (0=T-shirt, 1=Trouser, 2=Pullover, etc.)
- Embedding: One-hot vectors converted to learned embeddings
- Limitation: Fixed vocabulary of predefined categories

**Current Approach (Notebook 05)**:
- Labels: 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings
- Source: Pre-trained image encodings from each training image
- Capability: Infinite vocabulary through text descriptions

### Preprocessing Pipeline Implementation

```python
csv_path = 'clip.csv'

with open(csv_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    for idx, path in enumerate(data_paths):
        img = Image.open(path)
        clip_img = torch.tensor(np.stack([clip_preprocess(img)])).to(device)
        label = clip_model.encode_image(clip_img).tolist()
        writer.writerow([path] + label)
```

**Strategic Decision**: Pre-compute CLIP embeddings for all training images to:
- Accelerate training (avoid repeated CLIP inference)
- Enable batch processing efficiency
- Maintain consistent embeddings across epochs

### Dataset Architecture Modification

```python
class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, csv_path, preprocessed_clip=True):
        self.imgs = []
        self.preprocessed_clip = preprocessed_clip
        if preprocessed_clip:
            self.labels = torch.empty(
                len(data_paths), CLIP_FEATURES, dtype=torch.float, device=device
            )

        with open(csv_path, newline='') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
            for idx, row in enumerate(reader):
                img = Image.open(row)
                self.imgs.append(pre_transforms(img).to(device))
                if preprocessed_clip:
                    label = [float(x) for x in row[1:]]
                    self.labels[idx, :] = torch.FloatTensor(label).to(device)
```

**Key Innovation**: Labels are now 512-dimensional continuous vectors encoding rich semantic information rather than discrete categorical indices.

## Modified U-Net Architecture for CLIP Integration

### Architecture Evolution

```python
# Previous architecture (Notebook 04)
model = UNet_utils.UNet(
    T, IMG_CH, IMG_SIZE, down_chs=(256, 256, 512),
    t_embed_dim=8, c_embed_dim=10  # 10 categories
)

# Current architecture (Notebook 05)
model = UNet_utils.UNet(
    T, IMG_CH, IMG_SIZE, down_chs=(256, 256, 512),
    t_embed_dim=8, c_embed_dim=CLIP_FEATURES  # 512 CLIP features
)
```

**Critical Change**: The context embedding dimension expands from 10 (discrete categories) to 512 (CLIP features), enabling the model to process rich semantic information encoded in natural language descriptions.

### Context Integration Mechanism

The U-Net architecture seamlessly integrates CLIP embeddings through:

1.  **Context Embedding**: CLIP features are processed through learned linear layers
2.  **Feature Injection**: Context information is injected at multiple U-Net scales
3.  **Cross-Attention**: Deep integration between visual features and semantic context
4.  **Residual Connections**: Preserve both conditional and unconditional generation paths

### Context Masking for CLIP Embeddings

```python
def get_context_mask(c, drop_prob):
    c_mask = torch.bernoulli(torch.ones_like(c).float() - drop_prob).to(device)
    return c_mask
```

**Adaptation Required**: Unlike discrete categories, CLIP embeddings are continuous vectors. The masking strategy:
- Applies element-wise Bernoulli masking to the 512-dimensional embedding
- Maintains the same 10% drop probability for classifier-free guidance
- Enables learning both conditional and unconditional generation modes

## Text-to-Image Generation Pipeline

### The Complete Generation Process

```python
def sample_flowers(text_list):
    # Convert text to CLIP embeddings
    text_tokens = clip.tokenize(text_list).to(device)
    c = clip_model.encode_text(text_tokens).float()

    # Generate images using DDPM with CLIP conditioning
    x_gen, x_gen_store = ddpm_utils.sample_w(model, ddpm, INPUT_SIZE, T, c, device)
    return x_gen, x_gen_store
```

**Generation Flow**:
1.  **Text Input**: Natural language description (*"A beautiful red rose"*)
2.  **CLIP Encoding**: Convert text to 512-dimensional embedding
3.  **DDPM Sampling**: Use embedding as conditioning context
4.  **Classifier-Free Guidance**: Apply weighted sampling for enhanced quality
5.  **Image Output**: Generated image matching text description

### Classifier-Free Guidance with CLIP

The same classifier-free guidance principle from Notebook 04 applies, but with CLIP embeddings:

```python
# Conditional prediction (with CLIP context)
preds_cond = model(noises, ts, clip_context)

# Unconditional prediction (zero context)
preds_uncond = model(noises, ts, torch.zeros_like(clip_context))

# Weighted combination
preds = (1 + w) * preds_cond - w * preds_uncond
```

**Mathematical Formulation**:
$\epsilon_{\text{guided}} = (1 + w) \times \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c_{\text{clip}}) - w \times \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, \emptyset)$

Where $c_{\text{clip}}$ is the CLIP embedding and $\emptyset$ represents no conditioning.

## Training Process & Loss Function

### Enhanced Training Loop

```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for step, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        t = torch.randint(0, T, (BATCH_SIZE,), device=device).float()
        x, c = batch  # c is now CLIP embedding, not category
        c_mask = get_context_mask(c, c_drop_prob)
        loss = ddpm.get_loss(model_flowers, x, t, c, c_mask)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

**DDPM Loss with CLIP Conditioning**:
$L = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, \epsilon, t, c_{\text{clip}}} \left[ \left\| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon, t, c_{\text{clip}}) \right\|^2 \right]$

The loss function remains identical to previous notebooks, but the conditioning context $c_{\text{clip}}$ now carries rich semantic information from natural language rather than simple categorical labels.

### Dual Learning Strategy

```python
c_drop_prob = 0.1  # 10% probability of unconditional training
```

**Training Distribution**:
- **90% Conditional**: Learn to generate images matching CLIP embeddings
- **10% Unconditional**: Learn diverse generation without conditioning
- **Result**: Model capable of both guided and free generation

## Expected Outputs & Generation Quality

### Text-to-Image Results

When properly trained, the model generates:

**Input**: *"A round white daisy with a yellow center"*
**Output**: Daisy image with white petals and yellow center

**Input**: *"An orange sunflower with a big brown center"*
**Output**: Sunflower image with orange petals and brown center

**Input**: *"A deep red rose flower"*
**Output**: Rose image with red coloration

### Quality Assessment

The notebook demonstrates several key capabilities:

1.  **Semantic Understanding**: Generated images match text descriptions
2.  **Color Accuracy**: Correct color generation based on text prompts
3.  **Shape Recognition**: Proper flower shape generation
4.  **Detail Preservation**: Fine-grained feature control through language

### Limitations & Considerations

- **Dataset Dependency**: Quality limited to training data (flower images)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Effective prompts require understanding of training distribution
- **Semantic Boundaries**: Generated content bounded by CLIP's understanding
- **Resolution Constraints**: 32x32 pixel limitation for computational efficiency

## Prompt Engineering & Interactive Generation

### The Art of Prompting

```python
# Experiment with different prompts
text_list = [
    "A daisy",           # Simple prompt
    "A bright yellow sunflower",  # Color specification
    "A red rose bud"     # Shape and color combination
]
```

**Prompt Engineering Principles**:
- **Specificity**: More detailed descriptions often yield better results
- **Training Alignment**: Prompts matching training data distribution work best
- **Color Emphasis**: Color descriptions strongly influence generation
- **Object Focus**: Clear object identification improves consistency

### Real-Time Generation Control

The model enables interactive exploration:
- Modify prompts and observe generation changes
