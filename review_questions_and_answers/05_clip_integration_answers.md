## Beginner Level Answers

### Q1: What exactly is CLIP and what does it generate?

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) is not a generative model - it's an **embedding model** that creates numerical representations of images and text. Think of CLIP as a translator that converts both images and text into a common mathematical language.

CLIP outputs:
- **Text embeddings**: 512-dimensional vectors representing text meaning
- **Image embeddings**: 512-dimensional vectors representing visual content

The key insight is that CLIP learns to put semantically similar text and images close together in this 512-dimensional space. For example, the text "red rose" and an image of a red rose will have embeddings that are mathematically similar (high cosine similarity).

In our text-to-image pipeline:
1. **CLIP**: Converts "beautiful red rose" → 512 numbers
2. **Diffusion model**: Uses those 512 numbers to guide image generation
3. **Result**: Generated image that should match the text description

### Q2: How does text become numbers that a neural network can understand?

The transformation happens in two steps:

```python
# Step 1: Tokenization - text to integer tokens
text_tokens = clip.tokenize(text_list).to(device)
# "A round white daisy" → [49406, 320, 1395, 1943, 19716, 49407]

# Step 2: Encoding - tokens to semantic embeddings
clip_text_encodings = clip_model.encode_text(text_tokens).float()
# [49406, 320, 1395, 1943, 19716, 49407] → [0.23, -0.45, 0.67, ..., 0.12] (512 numbers)
```

**Tokenization**: Each word is mapped to a unique integer based on CLIP's vocabulary. Special tokens mark sentence boundaries.

**Encoding**: A transformer neural network processes the token sequence and outputs a single 512-dimensional vector that captures the semantic meaning. The network has learned to represent concepts like "round," "white," and "daisy" in a way that preserves their relationships.

The magic is that CLIP's training on millions of image-text pairs taught it to encode text such that semantically related concepts are numerically close.

### Q3: What's cosine similarity and why is it used?

Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors, regardless of their magnitude:

```python
similarity = (clip_text_encodings * clip_img_encoding).sum(-1)
# This is dot product, which equals cosine similarity for normalized vectors
```

**Why cosine?**
- **Scale invariant**: Focuses on direction, not magnitude
- **Interpretable range**: -1 (opposite) to +1 (identical)
- **Robust to normalization**: CLIP vectors are L2-normalized

**Interpretation**:
- **0.8**: Very similar concepts (e.g., "red rose" and image of red rose)
- **0.5**: Moderately related (e.g., "flower" and image of specific flower)
- **0.2**: Weakly related (e.g., "flower" and image of green leaves)
- **0.0**: Unrelated (e.g., "flower" and image of car)

### Q4: Why are the embeddings 512-dimensional?

512 dimensions represents a balance between **expressiveness** and **efficiency**:

**Expressiveness**: 512 dimensions can encode approximately 2^512 different concepts - more than enough for human language and visual concepts.

**Computational efficiency**:
- Small enough for fast similarity calculations
- Large enough to avoid information bottlenecks
- Power-of-2 size optimizes GPU operations

**Historical context**: CLIP researchers experimented with different sizes. 512 was found optimal for their model size and training data. Larger models (ViT-L) use higher dimensions (768), but with diminishing returns for most applications.

## Intermediate Level Answers

### Q5: How does CLIP create a "shared embedding space" for text and images?

CLIP uses **contrastive learning** with positive and negative pairs:

**Training setup**:
1. Start with batch of N image-text pairs (positive pairs)
2. Create N² total pairs (most are negative)
3. Train to maximize similarity of positive pairs, minimize similarity of negative pairs

**Loss function** (simplified):
```
For each positive pair (image_i, text_i):
- Maximize: similarity(image_i, text_i)
- Minimize: similarity(image_i, text_j) for all j ≠ i
- Minimize: similarity(image_j, text_i) for all j ≠ i
```

**Result**: The shared space emerges because:
- Images and text describing the same concept are pulled together
- Unrelated images and text are pushed apart
- The embedding space learns to encode semantic meaning rather than surface features

### Q6: What's the difference between image and text encoders in CLIP?

CLIP uses **specialized architectures** for each modality:

**Text Encoder** (Transformer):
- **Input**: Token sequences (variable length)
- **Architecture**: Causal attention (like GPT)
- **Strengths**: Sequential processing, context understanding
- **Output**: Single embedding from [EOS] token

**Image Encoder** (Vision Transformer - ViT-B/32):
- **Input**: Image patches (16×16 patches from 224×224 image)
- **Architecture**: Bidirectional attention
- **Strengths**: Spatial relationships, visual hierarchies
- **Output**: Single embedding from [CLS] token

**Why different architectures?**
- Text is **sequential**: meaning depends on word order
- Images are **spatial**: meaning comes from 2D relationships
- Each encoder optimized for its modality's structure

The key is both encoders output to the **same 512-dimensional space**.

### Q7: How does CLIP conditioning replace category conditioning?

The architectural change is in the **conditioning mechanism**:

**Category conditioning** (Notebook 04):
```python
# Discrete category (integer 0-9)
c = torch.randint(0, 10, (batch_size,))
# Embedded to continuous space
c_embed = embed_layer(c)  # e.g., 10 → 128 dimensions
```

**CLIP conditioning** (Notebook 05):
```python
# Continuous semantic embedding (512 dimensions)
c = clip_embeddings[batch_indices]  # Already 512-dimensional
```

**Advantages of CLIP conditioning**:
- **Richer information**: 512 semantic dimensions vs. 10 discrete categories
- **Continuous space**: Smooth interpolation between concepts
- **Hierarchical**: Can represent both "flower" and "red rose"
- **Compositional**: Combines multiple concepts ("beautiful red rose")

The U-Net architecture remains the same - it just receives richer conditioning signals.

### Q8: Why precompute CLIP embeddings instead of computing them during training?

**Computational efficiency**:
```python
# Precomputed (fast):
clip_embedding = dataset[idx][1]  # Load from CSV

# On-the-fly (slow):
clip_embedding = clip_model.encode_image(image)  # Forward pass through CLIP
```

**Benefits of precomputing**:

1. **Speed**: Avoid CLIP forward pass during training (3-5x faster)
2. **Memory**: Don't need CLIP model in GPU memory during diffusion training
3. **Stability**: Fixed embeddings ensure consistent training
4. **Flexibility**: Can experiment with different CLIP models without retraining diffusion

**Trade-offs**:
- **Storage**: CSV files are larger than simple labels
- **Flexibility**: Can't augment images during training (embeddings are fixed)

For production systems, on-the-fly computation is preferred for data augmentation benefits.

## Advanced Level Answers

### Q9: How does the text-to-image generation process actually work?

The mathematical process flows through several transformations:

**Step 1: Text to semantic embedding**
```
"red rose" → CLIP_text → c ∈ ℝ^512
```

**Step 2: Conditioning during denoising**
```
For each timestep t ∈ [T, T-1, ..., 1]:
    ε_pred = UNet(x_t, t, c)  # c guides noise prediction
    x_{t-1} = Sampler(x_t, ε_pred, t)  # Remove predicted noise
```

**Step 3: Classifier-free guidance**
```
ε_cond = UNet(x_t, t, c)      # With text conditioning
ε_uncond = UNet(x_t, t, ∅)    # Without conditioning
ε_guided = (1 + w) × ε_cond - w × ε_uncond  # Enhanced conditioning
```

**How conditioning works**:
- The semantic embedding c is injected into U-Net attention layers
- Attention mechanisms learn to correlate image features with text semantics
- Higher guidance weight w strengthens this correlation

**Mathematical intuition**: The U-Net learns a mapping from (noisy_image, text_meaning) → noise_to_remove, effectively implementing the conditional distribution p(x₀|text).

### Q10: What's the relationship between CLIP similarity and generation quality?

CLIP similarity is **necessary but not sufficient** for good generation:

**Strong correlation scenarios**:
- Text matches training distribution ("beautiful flower")
- Single concept descriptions ("red rose")
- CLIP can accurately encode the concept

**Weak correlation scenarios**:
- Complex compositions ("red rose in a blue vase on a wooden table")
- Abstract concepts ("melancholy flower")
- Out-of-distribution requests ("robot flower")

**Other quality factors**:
1. **Diffusion model capacity**: Can it generate fine details?
2. **Training data diversity**: Does it include similar concepts?
3. **Guidance weight**: Too high causes artifacts, too low ignores text
4. **Prompt engineering**: Better descriptions → better results

**Best practice**: Use CLIP similarity for **filtering** generated results, not as the sole quality metric.

### Q11: How does CLIP conditioning differ from classifier-free guidance mathematically?

The **guidance formula** remains identical:
$$\epsilon_t = (1 + w) \times \epsilon_{\text{cond}} - w \times \epsilon_{\text{uncond}}$$

But the **conditioning mechanism** changes:

**Category conditioning**:
- $\epsilon_{\text{cond}} = U\text{Net}(x_t, t, \text{category\_embedding})$
- $\epsilon_{\text{uncond}} = U\text{Net}(x_t, t, \text{zero\_embedding})$
- Discrete control space

**CLIP conditioning**:
- $\epsilon_{\text{cond}} = U\text{Net}(x_t, t, \text{clip\_embedding})$
- $\epsilon_{\text{uncond}} = U\text{Net}(x_t, t, \text{zero\_embedding})$
- Continuous semantic space

**Mathematical implications**:

1. **Interpolation**: CLIP allows smooth interpolation between concepts
2. **Composition**: Can blend multiple semantic concepts
3. **Hierarchy**: Natural progression from general ("flower") to specific ("red rose")
4. **Extrapolation**: Can combine familiar concepts in novel ways

The guidance magnitude w typically needs adjustment because CLIP embeddings have different magnitude distributions than category embeddings.

### Q12: What are the limitations of CLIP for text-to-image generation?

**Training data biases**:
- **Internet bias**: Overrepresents common Western concepts
- **Caption quality**: Many captions are noisy or incomplete
- **Cultural bias**: Underrepresents diverse global perspectives

**Semantic limitations**:
- **Compositional understanding**: Struggles with complex spatial relationships
- **Counting**: Poor at specific quantities ("three roses")
- **Abstract concepts**: Difficulty with emotions, styles, or metaphors
- **Negation**: Cannot handle "not" reliably ("flower without thorns")

**Technical limitations**:
- **Resolution dependency**: Trained on specific image sizes
- **Context length**: Limited to ~77 tokens
- **Modality gap**: Text and image embeddings occupy different subspaces

**Mitigation strategies**:
- Careful prompt engineering
- Iterative refinement
- Combining multiple modalities
- Domain-specific fine-tuning

## Implementation Answers

### Q13: How does tokenization handle different sentence lengths?

CLIP uses **fixed-length tokenization** with padding and truncation:

```python
# CLIP tokenization (simplified)
def tokenize(text, context_length=77):
    tokens = basic_tokenize(text)  # Split into words/subwords
    tokens = [start_token] + tokens + [end_token]  # Add special tokens

    if len(tokens) > context_length:
        tokens = tokens[:context_length]  # Truncate long sequences
    else:
        tokens = tokens + [pad_token] * (context_length - len(tokens))  # Pad short sequences

    return tokens  # Always returns exactly 77 tokens
```

**Key mechanisms**:
- **Start/end tokens**: [BOS] and [EOS] mark boundaries
- **Padding**: [PAD] tokens fill remaining positions
- **Attention masking**: Model ignores padding during computation
- **Context length**: 77 tokens maximum (about 50-60 words)

**Implications**:
- Short descriptions are padded → no information loss
- Long descriptions are truncated → potential information loss
- Fixed size enables efficient batch processing

### Q14: What happens to the context masking with CLIP embeddings?

Context masking with continuous embeddings uses **element-wise multiplication**:

```python
# Category masking (discrete)
if drop_context:
    c = torch.zeros_like(c)  # Set category to 0

# CLIP masking (continuous)
c_mask = torch.bernoulli(torch.ones_like(c).float() - drop_prob)
c = c * c_mask  # Element-wise multiplication
```

**Mathematical effect**:
- **Categorical**: Complete removal (0) or full presence (1)
- **CLIP**: **Partial removal** - some semantic dimensions preserved, others zeroed

**Semantic implications**:
- Randomly masking embedding dimensions creates **corrupted semantics**
- The model learns to handle **incomplete semantic information**
- This improves **robustness** and **unconditional generation**

**Alternative approaches**:
```python
# Better: Use learned null embedding instead of zeros
c_null = learnable_null_embedding  # Trained empty semantic representation
c = torch.where(mask, c, c_null)
```

### Q15: How does the dataset structure change with CLIP?

**Storage comparison**:

```python
# Category dataset
[image_path, category_id]
["flower1.jpg", 5]  # 1 integer per sample

# CLIP dataset
[image_path, embedding_dim1, embedding_dim2, ..., embedding_dim512]
["flower1.jpg", 0.23, -0.45, 0.67, ..., 0.12]  # 512 floats per sample
```

**Size implications**:
- **Category**: ~8 bytes per sample (path + int)
- **CLIP**: ~2KB per sample (path + 512 floats)
- **Scale factor**: ~250x larger for CLIP embeddings

**Loading performance**:
```python
# Fast loading strategy
embeddings = np.memmap('embeddings.npy', dtype=np.float32, mode='r')  # Memory-mapped
clip_embed = torch.from_numpy(embeddings[idx])  # Zero-copy loading
```

**Production optimizations**:
- Use HDF5 or similar for efficient storage
- Quantize embeddings (float16 or int8)
- Cache frequently used embeddings in memory

### Q16: Why use `.float()` when getting text encodings?

CLIP internally uses **mixed precision** training and may output **float16** tensors:

```python
# CLIP model might output float16
clip_output = clip_model.encode_text(text_tokens)  # Could be torch.float16

# Convert to float32 for compatibility
clip_text_encodings = clip_output.float()  # Ensures torch.float32
```

**Reasons for conversion**:

1. **Numerical stability**: float32 has higher precision for downstream computations
2. **Compatibility**: Other model components expect float32
3. **Loss computation**: CrossEntropyLoss and MSELoss work better with float32
4. **Gradient accumulation**: Higher precision needed for stable gradients

**Performance trade-offs**:
- **float16**: 2x memory savings, faster on modern GPUs
- **float32**: Better numerical stability, broader compatibility

For inference-only applications, keeping float16 is often acceptable and more efficient.

## Conceptual Answers

### Q17: How does "prompt engineering" work with CLIP?

Effective prompt engineering exploits CLIP's training patterns:

**Descriptive vs. keyword-based**:
```python
# Less effective
"rose"

# More effective
"a beautiful red rose with green leaves"
```

**Style and quality modifiers**:
```python
# Quality boosters (from internet captions)
"high quality", "professional photography", "detailed"

# Style descriptors
"oil painting style", "watercolor", "digital art"
```

**Compositional structure**:
```python
# Object + attribute + context
"a [object] [color/style] [adjective] in [setting] [style/quality]"
"a red rose beautiful flower in garden professional photography"
```

**Empirical principles**:
1. **Specificity**: More details generally improve results
2. **Common phrases**: Use language similar to internet captions
3. **Positive framing**: Describe what you want, not what you don't want
4. **Style consistency**: Match the training data distribution

### Q18: What's the difference between CLIP training and diffusion training?

These are **two separate training phases** with different objectives:

**CLIP Training** (Pre-training phase):
- **Data**: 400M image-text pairs from internet
- **Objective**: Contrastive learning - match images with captions
- **Architecture**: Dual encoders (text + image)
- **Output**: Learned embedding space
- **Scale**: Massive datasets, expensive training

**Diffusion Training** (Task-specific phase):
- **Data**: Smaller dataset (flowers) with CLIP embeddings
- **Objective**: Noise prediction conditioned on CLIP embeddings
- **Architecture**: U-Net with cross-attention
- **Input**: Uses frozen CLIP embeddings as conditioning
- **Scale**: Moderate datasets, faster training

**Relationship**:
1. **Sequential dependency**: Diffusion training requires pre-trained CLIP
2. **Transfer learning**: CLIP knowledge transfers to generation task
3. **Frozen vs. fine-tuned**: CLIP weights typically frozen during diffusion training

**Could they be trained jointly?**
Yes, but it's computationally prohibitive and usually unnecessary since CLIP generalization is excellent.

### Q19: How does this approach scale to complex scenes?

Complex scene generation reveals **fundamental limitations**:

**What works well**:
- **Single objects**: "red rose", "white daisy"
- **Simple compositions**: "flower in vase"
- **Style transfers**: "oil painting of flower"

**What struggles**:
- **Spatial relationships**: "rose to the left of the daisy"
- **Counting**: "three red roses"
- **Complex interactions**: "bee pollinating a flower"
- **Abstract concepts**: "wilting flower representing sadness"

**Technical challenges**:

1. **Attention limitations**: Cross-attention struggles with precise spatial control
2. **Compositional binding**: Difficulty associating attributes with specific objects
3. **Training data**: Complex scenes are rare in training data
4. **CLIP limitations**: Poor spatial reasoning in embedding space

**Modern solutions**:
- **Attention mechanisms**: Self-attention, cross-attention improvements
- **Structured representations**: Scene graphs, bounding boxes
- **Hierarchical generation**: Generate layout first, then details
- **Iterative refinement**: Multiple generation passes

### Q20: What's the relationship between CLIP and human language understanding?

CLIP exhibits **shallow semantic understanding** rather than deep comprehension:

**What CLIP captures**:
- **Statistical associations**: "red" often appears with "rose"
- **Visual correlations**: Red pixels correlate with "red" text
- **Distributional semantics**: Words with similar contexts have similar meanings

**What CLIP lacks**:
- **Causal understanding**: Doesn't understand why roses are red
- **Compositional reasoning**: Struggles with novel combinations
- **Abstract reasoning**: Limited understanding of metaphors, emotions
- **World knowledge**: No understanding of physics, biology, etc.

**Human vs. CLIP understanding**:

| Aspect | Human | CLIP |
|--------|-------|------|
| "Beautiful" | Aesthetic judgment, subjective experience | Statistical pattern from captions |
| "Red rose" | Botanical knowledge, sensory memory | Visual-textual correlation |
| "Metaphor" | Abstract conceptual mapping | Surface-level association |

**Implications**: CLIP is extremely useful for pattern recognition and matching but shouldn't be anthropomorphized as having human-like understanding.

## Training Answers

### Q21: How do you evaluate text-to-image generation quality?

Text-to-image evaluation requires **multiple complementary metrics**:

**Automatic metrics**:

1. **CLIP Score**: Similarity between generated image and text prompt
   ```python
   clip_score = cosine_similarity(clip_text_embed, clip_image_embed)
   ```

2. **FID (Fréchet Inception Distance)**: Distribution similarity to real images
   ```python
   fid = frechet_distance(real_features, generated_features)
   ```

3. **IS (Inception Score)**: Image quality and diversity
   ```python
   inception_score = exp(KL(p(y|x) || p(y)))
   ```

**Human evaluation**:
- **Semantic alignment**: Does image match text?
- **Visual quality**: Is image realistic/aesthetically pleasing?
- **Diversity**: Are generated images varied?

**Challenges**:
- **Subjectivity**: Beauty and relevance are subjective
- **Compositional complexity**: Hard to evaluate spatial relationships
- **Cultural bias**: Evaluation standards vary across cultures

**Best practice**: Combine automatic metrics with human evaluation for comprehensive assessment.

### Q22: What happens if the text description doesn't match the training dataset?

**Domain shift** creates predictable failure patterns:

**Training data**: Flowers dataset
**Out-of-domain prompt**: "purple elephant"

**Likely outcomes**:
1. **Closest match**: Generated image resembles purple flowers (dataset bias)
2. **Feature mixing**: Elephant-like shapes with flower textures
3. **CLIP guidance**: Some elephant-like features if CLIP knows elephants
4. **Complete failure**: Unrecognizable output

**Why this happens**:
- **Diffusion model**: Only learned flower distributions
- **CLIP embedding**: May contain elephant semantics
- **Mismatch**: Model tries to generate elephant using flower manifold

**Generalization factors**:

| Factor | Effect on "purple elephant" |
|--------|---------------------------|
| CLIP knowledge | May help with "elephant" concept |
| Diffusion training | Limited to flower-like outputs |
| Color concepts | "Purple" likely transfers well |
| Guidance weight | Higher w might force elephant features |

**Mitigation strategies**:
- **Diverse training data**: Include multiple object categories
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapt model to new domains
- **Compositional approaches**: Combine domain-specific models

### Q23: How do you debug poor text-to-image results?

**Systematic debugging approach**:

**Step 1: Analyze the text embedding**
```python
# Check if CLIP understands the text
text_embed = clip.encode_text(clip.tokenize(prompt))
similar_texts = find_nearest_neighbors(text_embed, text_database)
print(f"CLIP interprets '{prompt}' similarly to: {similar_texts}")
```

**Step 2: Test guidance scaling**
```python
# Try different guidance weights
for w in [1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0]:
    image = generate_with_guidance(prompt, guidance_weight=w)
    display(image, title=f"w={w}")
```

**Step 3: Examine intermediate steps**
```python
# Visualize denoising process
intermediate_images = []
for t in [100, 50, 20, 10, 1]:
    img = sample_at_timestep(x_t, t, prompt)
    intermediate_images.append(img)
```

**Common failure modes and solutions**:

1. **Text not understood**: Check CLIP vocabulary, rephrase prompt
2. **Wrong style**: Adjust style keywords, check training data
3. **Poor quality**: Increase guidance weight, check model convergence
4. **Ignoring text**: Verify conditioning implementation, check masking
5. **Artifacts**: Reduce guidance weight, check for mode collapse

**Debugging checklist**:
- [ ] Is the prompt in CLIP's vocabulary?
- [ ] Does the concept exist in training data?
- [ ] Are guidance weights appropriate?
- [ ] Is the model properly conditioned?
- [ ] Are there obvious failure patterns?

CLIP_model = 400MB       # ViT-B/32 parameters
UNet_model = 860MB       # U-Net with attention layers
Activations = 2-4GB      # Depends on batch size and resolution
Total = ~3-5GB          # For single image generation
```

**Computational costs**:

| Operation | Cost | Frequency |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| CLIP encoding | 50ms | Once per prompt |

### Q26: How would you extend this to other modalities?

**Audio-to-image generation**:

```python
# Replace CLIP with audio encoder
audio_embed = audio_encoder(audio_spectrogram)  # e.g., 512-dim
image = diffusion_model(noise, audio_embed)
```

**Challenges**:
- **Temporal alignment**: Audio has time dimension
- **Semantic mapping**: Audio→visual relationships less direct
- **Training data**: Fewer audio-image paired datasets

**Video-to-image generation**:

```python
# Use video encoder (e.g., VideoCLIP)
video_embed = video_encoder(video_frames)  # Aggregate temporal info
image = diffusion_model(noise, video_embed)
```

**Multi-modal conditioning**:

```python
# Combine multiple modalities
text_embed = clip_text(prompt)           # 512-dim
audio_embed = audio_encoder(audio)       # 512-dim
combined = text_embed + audio_embed      # Simple fusion
image = diffusion_model(noise, combined)
```

**Architecture considerations**:
- **Fusion strategies**: Concatenation, addition, attention-based
- **Alignment**: Ensure modalities are synchronized
- **Training**: Joint vs. sequential training approaches

## Research and Future Directions

### Q27: What are the current limitations of CLIP-based diffusion?

**Fundamental limitations**:

1. **Compositional understanding**:
   - Problem: "Red car next to blue house" → mixed colors
   - Cause: Attention mechanisms struggle with binding

2. **Spatial precision**:
   - Problem: "Circle above square" → imprecise positioning
   - Cause: CLIP lacks spatial reasoning

3. **Counting and quantities**:
   - Problem: "Three roses" → random number of flowers
   - Cause: Neither CLIP nor diffusion handle discrete quantities well

4. **Negation**:
   - Problem: "Flower without thorns" → may include thorns
   - Cause: CLIP trained on positive descriptions

**Active research directions**:

1. **Structured generation**:
   - Layout-to-image approaches
   - Scene graph conditioning
   - Bounding box guidance

2. **Compositional models**:
   - Object-centric representations
   - Factorized attention mechanisms
   - Modular generation pipelines

3. **Better evaluation**:
   - Human preference optimization
   - Automatic compositional evaluation
   - Fairness and bias metrics

### Q28: How does CLIP bias affect generated images?

**Sources of bias**:

1. **Training data bias**:
   - Internet overrepresents Western, affluent perspectives
   - Professional photos vs. casual snapshots
   - Commercial imagery bias

2. **Annotation bias**:
   - Captions written by specific demographics
   - Cultural assumptions in descriptions
   - Language-specific concepts

**Manifestations in generation**:

```python
# Biased associations learned from training data
"CEO" → predominantly male figures
"Nurse" → predominantly female figures
"Beautiful person" → narrow beauty standards
"Wedding" → Western-style ceremonies
```

**Technical bias sources**:
- **Frequency bias**: Common concepts dominate rare ones
- **Co-occurrence bias**: Spurious correlations become enforced
- **Representation bias**: Some groups underrepresented

**Mitigation strategies**:

1. **Dataset curation**: More balanced training data
2. **Bias-aware fine-tuning**: Explicitly counter biased associations
3. **Diverse evaluation**: Test across demographic groups
4. **User controls**: Allow explicit bias correction
5. **Transparency**: Document known biases and limitations

**Ongoing research**: Fairness-aware generation, bias detection metrics, inclusive AI development practices.

### Q29: What's the relationship between CLIP version and generation quality?

**CLIP model comparison**:

| Model | Parameters | Image Resolution | Text Context | Performance |
|-------|-----------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| ViT-B/32 | 86M | 224×224 | 77 tokens | Baseline |
| ViT-B/16 | 86M | 224×224 | 77 tokens | +10% quality |
| ViT-L/14 | 304M | 224×224 | 77 tokens | +25% quality |
| ViT-g/14 | 1.4B | 224×224 | 77 tokens | +35% quality |

**Quality improvements with larger CLIP**:

1. **Better semantic understanding**: Richer embeddings capture nuanced concepts
2. **Improved compositional ability**: Better handling of complex descriptions
3. **Reduced bias**: Larger models often have more balanced representations
